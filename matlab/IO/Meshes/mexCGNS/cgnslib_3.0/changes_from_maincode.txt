This version of CGNS was modified from cgns3.0.8 with the following changes:

- The ADF files produced are labled as version 2.54 instead of 3.0, so that 
  software that supports CGNS v2.x can still visualize the files correctly.
  The main changes are in cgnslib.[hc] and cgnsKeyworkds.h.

- The ADFH was made compatible with HDF5 v1.6. The only things that is not 
  supported by v1.6 is the links, which most files do not use. The main
  changes are in adfh/ADFH.h.

- Some bug fixes in cgnslib.[hc].
