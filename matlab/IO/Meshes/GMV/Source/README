The "gmvwrite" routines are callable from either C or Fortran and are used to 
simplify the process of creating GMV input files in the ieee binary format.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following files are included in the "gmvwrite" distribution:

-- gmvwrite.c		/* the C code */
-- gmvwritef.c		/* the Fortran INTERFACE code */
-- gmvwritelib.doc	/* documentation for all the functions */
-- sampfortran.f	/* a sample Fortran program using the "gmvwrite"
			   routines */
-- sampfortran2.f	/* a sample Fortran program using the "gmvwrite"
			   routines for ieei4r8 files */
-- samplec.c		/* a sample C program using the "gmvwrite" routines */
-- README		/* this file */

Additionally:
-- gmvread.c		/* C code that reads a GMV file */
-- gmvread.h		/* gmvread header file */
-- ascii2bin.c		/* sample C code that uses gmvread and gmvwrite */

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: gmvwrite can now write ascii files.  Use the following routines to 
      write an ascii file:
      gmvwrite_openfile_ascii(filename);
      gmvwrite_openfile_ir_ascii(filename, isize, rsize);
      These routines use the same arguments as their binary counterparts.

How to use in the C environment:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
To use the "gmvwrite" routines in the C programming language, you can either
include the code directly like this: #include "gmvwrite.c" or you can compile
it and link with the resulting object in the usual manner.

How to use in the Fortran environment:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
To use the "gmvwrite" routines in the Fortran programming language, you first
must compile "gmvwritef.c" as follows:

(note: "cc" is any ANSI C compiler)
for Hewlett Packard:	cc -Aa -c -Dhp gmvwritef.c       /* or */
                        gcc -c -Dhp gmvwritef.c
for Unicos:		cc -c -Dunicos gmvwritef.c
for all others:		cc -c gmvwritef.c

Save the object file the compiler creates and link it with whatever program
you're writing.  Note: the names of the Fortran versions of the functions
have the letter "f" added to the front of the name to distinguish them from
the C versions.  See the documentation.
