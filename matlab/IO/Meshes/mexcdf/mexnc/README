Regarding Official Mathworks Support
=======================================================================
Beginning with R2008b, the MathWorks is shipping MATLAB with official
support for netCDF.  The interface looks somewhat different than mexnc,
but mexnc has been augmented to be able to use the native MathWorks
support instead of the mexnc mex-file.  Just think, all you windows
users, no more fooling around with getting the netcdf.dll installed 
into the proper location!

The first question that may arise here is "will my old code continue
to work?"  The answer is a qualified "yes".  Just about everything 
works as before (so far as I know), but there are a couple of 
exceptions.

    1.  Writing attributes with NaN or Inf does not result in the same
	    datatype as it did with the mexnc-2 interface.  Since I cannot
		think of a good reason why one would want to do this in the
		first place, I haven't much sympathy for anyone who has a 
		problem with this.

    2.  The memory-mapped I/O routines are not supported by the 
	    MathWorks native mex-file.  For example, one cannot use

		mexnc('PUT_VARM_DOUBLE',...)

		anymore.  I do not believe this to be much of an issue because
		the main thing that these routines was good for was to permute
		data, and MATLAB is much faster at this than the netCDF library
		anyway.



R2008a and Earlier
=======================================================================
If you have MATLAB versions R2008a or earlier, then you need to 
realize that you still need the mex-file mexnc.  This is not included
in this download.  You need to either retrieve it from an earlier
release at sourceforge or compile it yourself (the source code IS 
still included).

SUPPORT
=======================================================================
Please note, mexnc is NOT supported by The MathWorks, so please do
not ask them questions about it.  If you encounter problems with
mexnc, you should continue to use the same contact email address
that is listed on the sourceforge web site.


OPeNDAP
=======================================================================
If you wish to use an opendap-enabled version of mexnc, then you have to
compile your mex-file yourself.  Take a look at the online notes at 
http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/opendap/ for further details.


Compiling your Own:
========================================================================
    You shouldn't be reading this far.  Please stop.

	No really ... stop.

    Alright, you really want to continue compiling your own mex-file.
	Take a look into the source directory and try to figure things out.


Problems?  
========================================================================
I don't have a lot of time for mexnc anymore, but you can still email me
at johne.g.evans.ne@gmail.com
